# SketchUp Ruby API Suggestions

After using the SketchUp Ruby API for some time, I've come across I few things
I'd like to see done differently, or to be added. Here's my WIP list of
suggestions.

## Have more suggestions?

If you know ruby, you can fork this repo, add it (either implement it or
create a method that raises a `NotImplementedError`) and document it then
submit a pull request.

If you don't know ruby - or just can't be bothered to do the above - open an
issue and describe the suggestion.

## Think I'm wrong?

Use the commenting features here on github. I'd love to hear from you.

## What's the point?

This is just as much organisation for me as it is getting this information
out. I've kept it somewhat organized and well described, but there's still a
lot of work to be done. Also, if I never do anything nothing will get done, so
here's me doing something.
